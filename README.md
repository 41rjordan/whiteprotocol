Terribly simple distributed network

This is simple program, which can connect to other nodes and form nodes chain, that is, distributed network. Works similar to BitTorrent.

Except of the connection itself, it supports one command - "whisper". This command spreads text message to nodes.

Most likely, this thing is very buggy and i will fix everything which doesn't work later
