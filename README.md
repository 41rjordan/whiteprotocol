Terribly simple distributed network

This is simple program, which can connect to other nodes and form nodes chain, that is, distributed network.&nbsp;Works similar to BitTorrent.

Except of the connection itself, it supports one command - "print". This command prints text message to node by password.&nbsp;This is test function
 on the base of which you can create RPC or something

Most likely, this thing is very buggy and i will fix everything which doesn't work later
