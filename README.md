Terribly simple distributed network

This is simple program, which can connect to other nodes and form nodes chain, that is, distributed network.\nWorks similar to BitTorrent.

Except of the connection itself, it supports one command - "print". This command prints text message to node by password.\nThis is test function
 on the base of which you can create RPC or something

Most likely, this thing is very buggy and i will fix everything which doesn't work later
